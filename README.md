## User Experience:
When the page loads the user is presented with a quiz box with disabled buttons for the choices. Once the Start button is clicked the quiz begins and the choice fields are populated with choices and the question is presented to the user right above the choices. The timer starts counting down from 50 seconds as well. Everytime the user selects the wrong answer the clock loses 5 seconds and a message is displayed with the word "wrong" with a sound effect. If the user selects the correct answer a message pops up with the word "correct" with a sound effect. Whether the selection is right or wrong a new question is displayed. When time runs out or the player finishes all questions the user is prompted to enter their initials and then the user can click the submit button. Once the user clicks the submit button the user is presented with the highscores that are stored in local storage. The user can also click the View Highscores link to view the high scores as well on the main page. On the Highscores page the user can click the Go Back button to go back to the main page or the Clear Highscores button that deletes all the scores.
